# AI Entry Point

This file is the canonical instruction set for any AI agent working on this project. Tool-specific files (CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules) should point here.

## Framework

This project uses the shared development framework. The framework path is specified in the `.framework-path` file in this directory.

## Getting Started

1. Read the framework's `modules/ai-instructions.md` — this is your operating manual
2. Read all files in `.context/` — this is the project context
3. Read `roadmap.md` — this is the current state of work
4. Read the specific task folder you've been assigned

## Override Resolution

If a file exists in `.overrides/` with the same name as a framework module, use the override version instead of the framework version.

## Current Overrides

None — this project uses all framework defaults.
<!-- Update this list when overrides are added -->

## Project-Specific Notes

<!-- Add any project-specific instructions that don't fit in .ctx/ files -->
